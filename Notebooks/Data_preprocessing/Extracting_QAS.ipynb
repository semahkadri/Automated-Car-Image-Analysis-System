Additionally, the base MSRP of this car is not available.\\n Now an in depth review of the honda accord 1999:\\n\\nFor the 1999 Honda Accord, coupes remain unchanged after their recent overhaul, but the sedans receive new seat fabric, and the LX and EX sedans now feature fold-away side mirrors. The benchmark.  The best-selling car in America.  The highest resale value in its class.  These are all statements that have been made with regularity concerning the Honda Accord, a vehicle that is always on the short list of the most popular cars in this country.  The Accord won a loyal base of customers by offering sprightly performance, room for four, frugal fuel economy and a virtual guarantee that, if cared for properly, the Accord would not break.  Totally redesigned last year, the Accord is still a raging bargain.  The sixth generation Accord is available in new coupe and sedan bodies.  A 3.0-liter V6 engine makes its debut in LX and EX models, marking the first six-cylinder VTEC in the Honda lineup.  The standard 2.3-liter four-banger is also re-engineered, as is the chassis.  And the new interior design creates more room inside than any of Accord's competitors.However, the low price is accompanied by a low level of equipment.  Fortunately what is included in the base price is good stuff.  The seats are comfortable, front and rear.  There is an immense amount of storage and passenger space inside the car.  Ergonomics are nearly flawless. The 200-horsepower 3.0-liter SOHC VTEC V6 is a model of refinement, revving smoothly and silently.  Braking and handling are good, the transmission shifts smoothly, and the steering is light and effortless.  The car is easy to drive, but doesn't reward the driver much for your efforts.  Body roll is excessive and the tires fold over at the first available opportunity when running the Accord along a curvy road.  The verdict?  Fast, but not much fun. A Japanese Buick Regal but with a somewhat choppy highway ride.As with the Toyota Camry, refinement and attention to detail are the Accord's strengths.  Almost all interior materials are pleasing to the eye and touch, and are assembled with great care.  Gap tolerances are about half what you'd find in American products.  Storage room abounds; the Accord resembles a minivan with so many places to stash maps, drinks, change, and assorted detritus.  Spacious, comfortable and quiet, the Accord will tote many happy campers for miles on end. While not exactly spicy, the Honda Accord is a quality, fine-tuned car exhibiting remarkable design because it is so functional and user friendly.  The bottom line is that Honda builds the ultimate midsize car.  A low price, a high level of refinement, a cavernous interior, and a well-deserved reputation for reliability put the Accord at the top of the heap.  Even a loaded EX model with leather, alloy wheels, power moonroof, automatic climate control, CD player, premium sound, and steering wheel radio controls stickers for less than $25,000.  The Accord is the definitive family sedan or coupe, and it's the benchmark by which all other midsize cars are measured.\""},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_QAS.loc[2000,'final_context']"],"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-25T21:13:56.438458Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-25T21:13:56.438856Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-25T21:13:56.447239Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-25T21:13:56.438823Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-25T21:13:56.445792Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"6DhNdb6voYWD","outputId":"fac4ef02-9b56-4dd8-ed85-bc11acf306b2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"execution_count":133,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"\"The subaru legacy 2012 is a vehicle with a Flat 4 engine that delivers 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft torque at 4,000.

Additionally, the base MSRP of this car is $19,995.\\n Now an in depth review of the subaru legacy 2012:\\n\\nBesides a new audio system for upper trim levels and some minor shuffling of features, the Subaru Legacy returns largely unchanged for 2012. But  some of what makes it unique also serves to limit its appeal. On the downside, the Subaru Legacy's weight and reduced  efficiency from routing power to all four wheels results in less favorable fuel  economy numbers. Its road-holding prowess in inclement weather is a plus, for  sure, but if you live in milder climates, it may be harder to justify. Furthermore, the sporty 2.5 GT Limited is not available with an automatic  transmission, and a rather fussy navigation system is an option only for the  range-topping trim levels. The 3.6R features a 3.6-liter boxer six-cylinder good for  256 hp and 247 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual is the  only transmission choice. It goes from zero to 60 mph in a rapid 5.7 seconds. The seats are comfortable, with plenty of headroom and rear  seat legroom. In terms of technology, iPod control and streaming Bluetooth  audio are available, but not on the base models. The 2.5i Limited adds 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), the All Weather package, a  four-way power passenger seat, dual-zone automatic climate control and a  nine-speaker Harman Kardon sound system with satellite radio.\""},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_QAS.to_csv('/kaggle/working/Summary_Final_context.csv', index=False)"],"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-25T21:14:07.169514Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-25T21:14:07.169944Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-25T21:14:07.468121Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-25T21:14:07.169910Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-25T21:14:07.466696Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"PEoMPmKDoYWD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["final_df = pd.DataFrame()"],"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-25T22:18:02.863731Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-25T22:18:02.864189Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-25T22:18:02.871304Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-25T22:18:02.864153Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-25T22:18:02.869753Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"UyJcqjJToYWD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def generate_question(row):\n","    question_list = [\n","        \"What is the horsepower rating of the engine in the {0}?\".format(row['Full Name']),\n","        \"How much horsepower does the {0}'s engine produce?\".format(row['Full Name']),\n","        \"What is the horsepower output of the {0}'s engine?\".format(row['Full Name']),\n","        \"Can you tell me the horsepower of the engine in the {0}?\".format(row['Full Name']),\n","        \"How many horsepower does the {0}'s engine generate?\".format(row['Full Name'])\n","    ]\n","    question = random.choice(question_list)\n","    answer = str(row['horsepower'])\n","    context = row['final_context'].strip()\n","    start_pos = context.find(answer)\n","    end_pos = start_pos +len(answer)+len(\"horsepower\")\n","    return question, answer, start_pos, end_pos, context"],"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.173351Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.173780Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.182781Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.173744Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.181131Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"uwM7pIEdoYWE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["QAS = pd.DataFrame(columns=['question', 'answer', 'start_pos', 'end_pos', 'final_context'])"],"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.563216Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.563612Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.571670Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.563579Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.570648Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"qyVJ6_qHoYWE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["QAS = data_QAS.apply(generate_question, axis=1, result_type='expand')\n","QAS.columns = ['question', 'answer', 'start_pos', 'end_pos', 'context']"],"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.853304Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.854385Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-25T22:18:04.116321Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-25T22:18:03.854328Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-25T22:18:04.114425Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"6OwkRdBzoYWE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["QAS.loc[1,'context']"],"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-25T22:18:04.154195Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-25T22:18:04.155259Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-25T22:18:04.164800Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-25T22:18:04.155188Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-25T22:18:04.163114Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"nYj-8rfkoYWF","outputId":"fa448a13-320f-4bfb-bb2f-54e49ef9ff8d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"execution_count":298,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"\"The toyota 4runner 2005 is a vehicle with a V6 engine that delivers 245 horsepower and 282 lb-ft torque at 3,800.
